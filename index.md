### Project Based Learning
https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning

A list of programming tutorials in which learners build an application from scratch. These tutorials are divided into different primary programming languages. Some have intermixed technologies and languages. To get started, simply fork this repo. Please refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for contribution guidelines.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/fsj-digital/page/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fsj-digital/page/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
